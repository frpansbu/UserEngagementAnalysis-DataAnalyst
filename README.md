# UserEngagementAnalysis-DataAnalyst

The product team at Showwcase wants to better understand "user engagement" on the platform in the last month
(October 2019 in this exercise). You are free to define engagement, find insights, and question any other metrics we
can use to understand our approach better. Your role is to present your findings based on the data. Note - The
sample dataset may have data integrity issues; if so, you should base your analysis accordingly.
